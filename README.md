Honestly, it's probably FAR easier to do what groups like Universal Blue do and manually track and hold back releases until the correct ZFS release is available than to maintain this insane bit of code the AI has tried to make while covering all possibilities.

This repository builds a signed Kinoite image with:

- ZFS userspace and kernel modules installed from a self-hosted akmods cache image, meaning a container image that stores prebuilt ZFS kernel-module packages
- `distrobox`
- Homebrew from the official `ghcr.io/ublue-os/brew:latest` OCI image
- a single-repository signing policy for future signed `bootc upgrade` flows

The documentation in this repository tries to stay readable for someone who is learning these topics while reading. Terms are defined when they first appear where practical, and the glossary fills in the rest.

## Why This Repo Exists

The problem has not changed:

1. Fedora-family images move kernels quickly.
2. ZFS is an out-of-tree kernel module.
3. That means a new Fedora kernel can arrive before a matching OpenZFS release is ready.
4. If you do not gate builds carefully, you can publish a Kinoite image whose kernel and ZFS modules do not match.

This repository intentionally uses:

1. a standard `Containerfile`
2. direct `buildah`/Open Container Initiative (OCI) build arguments
3. one image repository (`ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile`)
4. one shared akmods cache repository (`ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile-akmods`)

## Safety Model

Stable users should only see tested outputs.

So the `main` GitHub Actions workflow does this:

1. resolve and pin the exact base image, kernel set, builder image, and ZFS line for the run
2. reuse or rebuild the shared akmods cache image for that exact kernel set
3. publish or repair a tiny metadata tag that records which kernels that shared cache covers
4. build a candidate image tag in the same repository
5. sign that candidate digest
6. promote the tested candidate digest to `latest` and to an immutable audit tag
7. sign the promoted `latest` digest

If candidate fails, `latest` does not move.

## What Gets Published

All of these tags are stored in GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), which is the container-image registry behind `ghcr.io`.

OS image tags in one repository:

- candidate image: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:candidate-<sha>-<fedora>`
- stable image: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:latest`
- stable audit tag: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:stable-<run>-<sha>`
- branch test image: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:br-<branch>-<fedora>`
  - bot-authored branch runs validate locally but intentionally do not push this tag

Shared akmods cache image:

- `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile-akmods:main-<fedora>`
- architecture-specific inspection tag: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile-akmods:main-<fedora>-x86_64`
- metadata tag: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile-akmods:main-<fedora>-metadata`

The important simplification is this:

- there is no separate `*-candidate` image repository anymore
- there is no branch-scoped public akmods alias repo anymore
- there is no host repair script for stable-vs-candidate trust drift anymore

## How Akmods Source Is Chosen

This repository uses the configured akmods fork:

- `https://github.com/Danathar/akmods.git`

But it does **not** build from the moving `main` branch tip.

Instead, it builds from one exact commit recorded in:

- [`ci/defaults.json`](./ci/defaults.json)

Right now that file contains:

1. the fork URL
2. one exact Git commit identifier (usually shortened to commit SHA)

What that means in practice:

1. the GitHub Actions workflow run (usually shortened to CI, for continuous integration) makes a temporary clone of that fork into `/tmp/akmods`
2. it fetches only that one pinned commit
3. it verifies that Git actually checked out that exact commit
4. it uses that temporary checkout for the rest of the akmods build

What it does **not** mean:

1. the workflow run is not creating a new long-lived clone anywhere in the GitHub account that owns the fork
2. the workflow run is not ignoring the configured fork
3. the workflow run is not automatically picking up whatever new commits later appear on that fork's `main` branch

If the fork is updated after upstream changes:

1. that fork stays the source repository
2. this repo will still keep using the currently pinned commit
3. the new fork commit only starts being used after the pin in `ci/defaults.json` is updated

## Core Workflows

- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
  - main push/schedule/manual workflow
  - candidate-first build and promotion
- `.github/workflows/build-branch.yml`
  - branch-tagged test builds
  - read-only reuse of the shared akmods cache
- `.github/workflows/build-pr.yml`
  - pull request (PR) validation build
  - no push and no signing

Docs-only changes do not trigger image builds.

## Native Build Flow

At a high level, the final image build now works like this:

1. `Containerfile` starts from `ghcr.io/ublue-os/kinoite-main`
2. `COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/brew:latest /system_files /` imports the official brew payload
3. `build_files/build-image.sh` enables the brew services/timers, installs `distrobox`, installs ZFS RPMs (Red Hat Package Manager package files) from the shared akmods cache image, writes signing policy, and commits the ostree container
4. `bootc container lint` validates the final image

Three workflow-side simplifications now support that image build:

1. `ci/defaults.json` is the one checked-in source of truth for default image refs, image names, and the pinned akmods fork commit
2. the shared akmods cache publishes a `main-<fedora>-metadata` metadata tag so later validation runs can usually answer cache-reuse questions from registry metadata alone
3. small repo-owned Python helpers now handle registry-context export, candidate-tag generation, branch-tag composition, and signing-policy file generation instead of leaving that logic inline in workflow or shell snippets

One Fedora-version detail matters here:

1. GitHub Actions usually passes an exact `AKMODS_IMAGE` reference for the detected Fedora major version
2. local builds do not need a hard-coded Fedora major version in `Containerfile`
3. when `AKMODS_IMAGE` is not passed, the install helper renders `AKMODS_IMAGE_TEMPLATE`
   with the Fedora major version detected from the chosen base image itself

The ZFS install step still has one important workaround:

- if the base image ships more than one installed kernel under `/lib/modules`, the helper installs one `kmod-zfs` package through `rpm-ostree` and unpacks the remaining kernel payloads directly into the image root before running `depmod`

That logic lives in:

- [`containerfiles/zfs-akmods/install_zfs_from_akmods_cache.py`](./containerfiles/zfs-akmods/install_zfs_from_akmods_cache.py)

## Install And Rebase

> [!WARNING]
> This is an experimental image stream.

Fresh stock Kinoite:

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:latest
systemctl reboot
```

Why this image flow stays easier to reason about:

1. the stable and candidate image tags live in the same repository
2. after you boot into this image family once, the in-image policy only needs to trust one repository path
3. there is no dual-repository policy normalization or host repair path to keep in sync

## Quick Validation After Boot

```bash
rpm -q kmod-zfs
modinfo zfs | head
zpool --version
zfs --version
distrobox --version
brew --version
```

For virtual machine (VM) testing with a secondary disk:

```bash
sudo wipefs -a /dev/vdb
sudo zpool create -f -o ashift=12 -O mountpoint=none testpool /dev/vdb
sudo zfs create -o mountpoint=/var/mnt/testpool testpool/data
sudo zpool status
sudo zfs list
```

## Signature Verification

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:latest
```
