#
# Script: build_files/build-image.sh
# What: Applies all image customizations in one place during the native build.
# Doing: Enables brew services, installs distrobox, installs cached ZFS RPMs,
#        writes the in-image signing policy, and commits the ostree container.
# Why: A separate build script is easier to read than one large Containerfile
#      shell block, and it keeps the teaching comments close to the steps.
# Goal: Produce one bootable Kinoite image with ZFS, distrobox, brew, and
#       repository trust configuration.

# CI passes the exact image today, while local builds usually rely on the

# Remove build-only runtime state before the final ostree commit.
# Why these paths are safe to drop:
# 1. `/run` is runtime-only state and should not be baked into the image.
# 2. `/var/lib/containers` here came from build-time image inspection, not from
#    something users need at runtime after deployment.
# 3. Some builders leave resolver files bind-mounted under `/run/systemd`.
#    Those specific paths can be busy, so cleanup here must be best-effort
#    instead of failing the entire image build on a harmless leftover mount.
