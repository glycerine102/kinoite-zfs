# ZFS On Kinoite Testing Design

If a term is unfamiliar, check the shared glossary first:
[`docs/glossary.md`](./glossary.md)

## Purpose

This repository is a controlled testbed for ZFS support on Kinoite using a native `Containerfile` build.

The objective is to validate that we can safely:

1. track the current Kinoite/Fedora kernel stream
2. build ZFS kernel modules against that exact kernel set
3. install those modules into the final bootc image
4. fail in CI before a broken image replaces `latest`

## Constraints And Context

1. Kinoite is an ostree/bootc-style image, so ZFS integration must happen during image build.
2. ZFS compatibility can lag new Fedora kernels.
3. Branch testing must not overwrite `latest`.
4. PR validation should exercise the real build logic but should not push anything.
5. The shared akmods cache should be rebuilt only by `main`, not by branch/PR validation.

## Artifact Strategy

### Main Artifacts

1. candidate OS image: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:candidate-<sha>-<fedora>`
2. stable OS image: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:latest`
3. stable audit tag: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:stable-<run>-<sha>`
4. shared akmods cache image: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile-akmods:main-<fedora>`
5. shared akmods cache metadata sidecar: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile-akmods:main-<fedora>-metadata`

### Branch Artifacts

1. human-authored branch image: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-containerfile:br-<branch>-<fedora>`
2. bot-authored branch runs stop after local validation and do not push any public tag
3. shared akmods cache stays the same shared source image; branch builds do not publish branch-specific cache tags

## End-To-End Build Flow

### 1. Detect Base Kernel Stream

The main workflow resolves build inputs in one of two modes:

1. default mode: resolve floating refs to immutable digests and immutable stream tags at run time
2. replay mode: read pinned inputs from [`ci/inputs.lock.json`](../ci/inputs.lock.json)

After resolving the base image, the workflow inspects `/lib/modules` inside the pinned base image so it knows every installed kernel, not just one metadata label.

### 2. Validate Existing Shared Akmods Cache

Before rebuilding akmods, CI checks whether the shared cache image already contains a matching `kmod-zfs-<kernel_release>` RPM for every base-image kernel.

That check now prefers the metadata sidecar first:

1. inspect `main-<fedora>-metadata` and read its cached kernel-release label
2. only if that sidecar tag is missing or malformed, unpack the full shared cache image and inspect the RPM filenames directly

If any kernel is missing, rebuild is forced.

### 3. Build Shared Akmods Cache When Required

If cache is missing/stale (or manual rebuild is requested), CI:

1. clones the pinned `Danathar/akmods` commit
2. points its target output to `zfs-kinoite-containerfile-akmods`
3. seeds cache metadata for every detected kernel
4. builds kernel-specific payloads when needed
5. merges those payloads into one shared Fedora-wide cache image
6. publishes the `main-<fedora>-metadata` sidecar tag for future fast-path reuse checks

### 4. Build Candidate Or Branch Image

The final image build is standard OCI composition now.

CI passes build arguments directly into [`Containerfile`](../Containerfile):

1. `BASE_IMAGE`
2. `BREW_IMAGE`
3. `AKMODS_IMAGE`
4. `IMAGE_REPO`
5. `SIGNING_KEY_FILENAME`

That means there is no generated workspace and no per-run file mutation layer.

### 5. Sign Published Tags

Non-PR published tags are signed after push by resolving the pushed tag to a digest and then signing that digest.

This keeps signature behavior consistent for:

1. candidate tags
2. branch tags
3. stable `latest`

Branch note:

- only human-authored branch runs push/sign branch tags
- bot actors such as Dependabot still run the build, but they stop before GHCR push/signing so the registry does not fill with unsigned automation artifacts

### 6. Promote Candidate To Stable

Promotion only copies the tested candidate digest to:

1. `latest`
2. `stable-<run>-<sha>`

Then `latest` is signed explicitly.

## Why This Repo Is Simpler Than The BlueBuild Version

1. no generated BlueBuild workspace
2. no recipe mutation
3. no second image repository for candidate
4. no candidate/stable repo-policy normalization inside the image
5. no host repair script for dual repository trust drift

## What Is Still Intrinsically Hard

1. Fedora kernel timing vs OpenZFS release timing
2. shared akmods cache rebuild rules
3. multi-kernel fallback support in the final image

Those are the real complexity drivers that remain.
