"""
Script: ci_tools/akmods_clone_pinned.py
What: Clones the exact akmods commit configured for this repository into `/tmp/akmods`.
Doing: Recreates the directory, fetches one commit, checks detached HEAD, and verifies the SHA.
Why: Ensures we build from a known source version without mutating the cloned worktree at runtime.
Goal: Prepare a clean akmods checkout for later configure/build steps.
